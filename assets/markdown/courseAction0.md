## Install Software

We need to install some software to be able to complete the course. There are a couple of ways we could do this:

- Attempt to use Nix: [https://nix.dev/install-nix](https://nix.dev/install-nix)
    - Should require less of your input
    - For this course, isn't well tested outside of MacOs

- Install each component manually
    - Very likely to work
    - May take more time
    - Needs more attention to detail

## Which do you choose?

### Nix

- Download and extract the source code from this repo [https://github.com/thatdogmachine/public_breakthrough_flutter/releases/tag/v0.0.1](https://github.com/thatdogmachine/public_breakthrough_flutter/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
- Install Nix: [https://nix.dev/install-nix](https://nix.dev/install-nix)
- From a terminal / comand prompt run: NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-shell - see the button below to copy the text to your Clipboard.
