Some of these actions will contain commands you can / should type into a terminal, eg:

```dart
    echo "hello from the terminal"
```

Where such commands are listed, you can either:
- read & type them to a terminal by hand

or:

- copy them to the clipboard using buttons at the bottom of the page (scroll down if you don't see them)
- paste them into a terminal, using Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+V depending on your operating system
