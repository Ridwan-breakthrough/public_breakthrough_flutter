## Flutter

Check that flutter is installed and working, from a terminal:

If you installed with nix, make sure you already did:

```dart
    NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix-shell
```
in your terminal, then:

```dart
    pwd

    flutter doctor

    flutter create my_first_flutter_app

    flutter run -d chrome
```
